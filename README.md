Notes:
 - Anything that has "test" as its commit message may still need some updating! See https://github.swarthmore.edu/kgelber1/SSX-Python3/wiki/Py2-to-Py3-notes for details
 - Python2 repository can be found here: https://github.swarthmore.edu/kgelber1/SSX-Python2
   (or add "from __future__ import division, print_function, absolute_import" to the top line of each file)
    I did try to maintain some level of backwards compatibility, but not guaranteed. 
 - Older python3 repository can be found here: https://github.swarthmore.edu/kgelber1/SSX-Python3
    
- I put a gitignore in the data folder so it wouldn't clog thins up unnecessarily
